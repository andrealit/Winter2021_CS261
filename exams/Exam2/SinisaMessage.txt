Hello,

I am sending you solutions of Exam2 for all three groups. You can also see the number of points for important lines of code that we will be grading.

For Group1, my solution of addSmartQueue() is distributed in 4 additional functions: containsDList(); addBackDList (); addDLink ();

For Group2, my solution of removeRepsBag() uses an additional function _removeDLink().

For Group3, my solution of pushStack() and merge2stacks() uses an additional function _addDLink(). 

We will use the following strategy for grading:
- If the code compiles well, and gives correct output for multiple test cases = 100 points.
- Otherwise, we will visually inspect every line of code, and give partial credit for your solutions.

Sinisa
